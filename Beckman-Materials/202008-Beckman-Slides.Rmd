# Who cares about reproducibility & VC?

- American Statistical Association [^1][^2][^3]
- National Science Foundation [^3][^4]
- CS education (e.g., ACM SIGCSE) [^5][^6]
- Employers, Practitioners, & Students [^7]

# The Kubler-Ross model [^8]

...better known as the 5 stages of grief:

>- **Denial:** We never taught Git before, what's the big deal?
>- **Anger:** ANOTHER learning objective?!  *SERIOUSLY??*
>- **Bargaining:** Can't students just pick it up on their own?
>- **Depression:** I don't know *anything* about Git...
>- **Acceptance:** Wait, there are buttons in RStudio? Maybe it won't be so bad after all...

# Reproducibility: 

- roughly speaking, the code "just works" with no changes needed
- completely self-contained including...
    - source data
    - code book
    - package versions
    - all data wrangling/prep steps
    - recreate all analysis, models, visuals
    - final reporting
- easy to verify results or refresh if source data updates
- ethical practice

# Version control (1/2)

- collaboration among users
- self-collaboration--e.g., RStudio Desktop and RStudio Server

# Version control (2/2)

- maintains the evolution of the project
- safely explore alternative solutions/ideas in parallel

# Reproducibility $\ne$ Version Control

Sometimes lumped together as if they're one in the same, and it's even tempting to speak of Git(Hub) as a panacea... 

### They aren't and it isn't... 

Our motivation: invest in good habits with a professional workflow designed to streamline **both** virtues.


# Ethical practice

- Any analysis may require hundreds of tiny decisions
- Many of these decisions may be handled in private by a single person
- Our work is often intended for audience without the expertise required to scrutinize those decisions 

### With reproducibility & version control

- all decisions are documented
- all results can be checked
- proper scrutiny is possible (now or in future)
