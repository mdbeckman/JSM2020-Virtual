# Who cares?

- ASA, NSF, CSE, employers, & students

- 2014 Curriculum Guidelines ...Statistical Science
- 2016 Curriculum Guidelines ...Data Science
- CS education calls for version control in the curriculum (e.g., Haaranen & Lehtinen, 2015; Zagalsky et al., 2015)
- 2017 Kaggle Study



# Reproducibility: 

- completely self-contained including...
    - source data
    - code book
    - all data wrangling/prep steps
    - recreate all analysis, models, visuals
    - final reporting
- easy to verify results or refresh if source data updates
- e.g., all code "just works" with no changes needed

 
# Version control

- maintains the evolution of the project
- safely explore alternative solutions/ideas in parallel

# Version control 

- collaboration among users
- self-collaboration--e.g., RStudio Desktop and RStudio Server

# Reproducibility $\ne$ Version Control

- Sometimes lumped together as if they're one in the same, and it's tempting to speak of Git(Hub) as a panacea... 
- They aren't and it isn't... 

Our motivation: invest in good habits with a professional workflow designed to streamline **both** virtues.


# Ethical practice

- Any analysis may require hundreds of tiny decisions
- These decisions may necessarily be handled by a single person
- Work products are often intended for audience without technical expertise to scrutinize those decisions 

### With reproducibility & version control

- all decisions are documented
- all results can be checked
- proper scrutiny is possible (now or in future)

# Industry & Academic Preparedness
    - programming is a collaborative sport
    - effective entry point for research participation
- Industry Preparedness
    - programming is a collaborative sport
    - quite common to refresh standard reports
